commands: {}
principles:
  - '**Integrate, do not average**: Combine perspectives meaningfully, not by compromise'
  - '**Resolve tensions productively**: Contradictions often point to deeper insights'
  - '**Crystallize for clarity**: Distill to essential, communicable form'
  - '**Preserve nuance in summary**: Simplify without losing important complexity'
best_practices:
  - '**Review all exploration notes**: Synthesize the full journey'
  - '**Identify recurring themes**: Note patterns across sessions'
  - '**Resolve outstanding questions**: Address or explicitly defer open items'
  - '**Test crystallized form**: Verify summary captures essence'
checklist:
  - All exploration and refinement notes reviewed
  - Key themes and patterns identified
  - Tensions acknowledged and resolved (or noted as unresolved)
  - Core insight crystallized in clear statement
  - Summary captures essence without losing nuance
  - Next steps or implications documented

## Perspective combination

### Why combine perspectives

During exploration and critique, multiple viewpoints emerge:

- Different stakeholder needs
- Competing technical approaches
- Varying scope options
- Alternative use cases

Synthesis integrates these into a coherent whole.

### Integration techniques

**Layered integration**

Organize perspectives as layers that work together:

```
Layer 1: Core (serves all perspectives)
Layer 2: Extensions (serves specific audiences)
Layer 3: Customizations (individual needs)
```

**Prioritized integration**

Rank perspectives and satisfy in order:

1. Primary perspective (must satisfy)
2. Secondary perspectives (should satisfy)
3. Tertiary perspectives (nice to satisfy)

**Dialectical integration**

Find synthesis through thesis-antithesis pattern:

1. State position A (thesis)
2. State opposing position B (antithesis)
3. Find higher-order integration C (synthesis)

### Documentation template

```markdown
## Perspective integration

### Perspectives considered
1. **[Perspective A]**: [Summary of viewpoint]
2. **[Perspective B]**: [Summary of viewpoint]
3. **[Perspective C]**: [Summary of viewpoint]

### Integration approach
[How perspectives are combined]

### Trade-offs made
- [Perspective X] prioritized over [Perspective Y] because [reason]
- [Aspect] deferred to satisfy [constraint]

### Resulting synthesis
[Description of integrated approach]
```

## Tension resolution

### Identifying tensions

Tensions arise from:

- Conflicting requirements
- Incompatible approaches
- Resource competition
- Stakeholder disagreements
- Technical trade-offs

### Resolution strategies

| Strategy | When to use | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Prioritize | One concern dominates | Security over convenience |
| Sequence | Both needed, different times | Simple now, complex later |
| Segment | Different contexts, different solutions | Mobile vs desktop |
| Transcend | Find option that satisfies both | New approach avoiding trade-off |
| Accept | Trade-off is inherent | Document and proceed |

### Tension documentation

```markdown
## Tensions and resolutions

### [Tension 1]: [X] vs [Y]

**Description**: [What creates the tension]
**Stakes**: [Why it matters]
**Options considered**:
1. Favor X: [Implications]
2. Favor Y: [Implications]
3. Alternative approach: [Description]

**Resolution**: [Chosen approach]
**Rationale**: [Why this resolution]
**Residual tension**: [What remains unresolved]
```

### Productive tension

Some tensions are features, not bugs:

- **Creative tension**: Drives innovation
- **Healthy constraints**: Focus effort
- **Dynamic balance**: Prevents extremes

Document which tensions to preserve rather than resolve.

## Insight crystallization

### What is crystallization

Crystallization transforms developed thinking into clear, actionable form:

- Messy notes become clear statements
- Multiple threads become unified narrative
- Implicit understanding becomes explicit knowledge
- Personal insight becomes shareable wisdom

### The crystallization process

1. **Review all materials**: Read through exploration notes, variations, critiques
2. **Identify core insight**: What's the essential discovery or proposal?
3. **Test for clarity**: Can you explain it in one sentence?
4. **Preserve context**: What must someone know to understand it?
5. **Make actionable**: What does this insight enable?

### Core insight statement

Craft a single statement that captures the essence:

**Template:**

```
[Problem/opportunity] can be addressed by [approach/insight] because [key reasoning], enabling [value/outcome].
```

**Examples:**

- "Developer onboarding delays can be addressed by automated environment setup because configuration complexity is the primary friction, enabling same-day productivity for new hires."

- "User churn from feature overload can be addressed by progressive disclosure because users need graduated complexity, enabling both simplicity and power."

### Crystallization quality checklist

- [ ] One-sentence summary possible
- [ ] Core insight is non-obvious
- [ ] Reasoning is clearly stated
- [ ] Action implications are clear
- [ ] Key context is preserved
- [ ] Nuances are noted (not lost)

## Summary techniques

### Summary levels

Different audiences need different summary depths:

| Level | Length | Audience | Focus |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Headline | 1 sentence | Anyone | Core insight |
| Abstract | 1 paragraph | Stakeholders | Key points and implications |
| Executive | 1 page | Decision makers | Context, insight, recommendations |
| Full | Multi-page | Implementers | Complete documentation |

### Writing effective summaries

**Headline (1 sentence)**

- State the core insight
- Include the key implication
- Avoid jargon

**Abstract (1 paragraph)**

1. Opening: Context/problem
2. Middle: Approach/insight
3. Closing: Implications/value

**Executive summary (1 page)**

1. Problem statement (1-2 sentences)
2. Core insight (1-2 sentences)
3. Key supporting points (3-5 bullets)
4. Implications and recommendations (2-3 bullets)
5. Next steps (2-3 bullets)

### Summary documentation

```markdown
## Summary

### Headline
[One sentence capturing the essence]

### Abstract
[One paragraph summary]

### Key points
- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]
- [Point 3]

### Implications
- [Implication 1]
- [Implication 2]

### Recommendations
- [Recommendation 1]
- [Recommendation 2]

### Open questions
- [Question that remains unanswered]
- [Area needing further exploration]
```
