## Core concept

[The essential technical concept in 2-3 sentences]

## Context

[What technical problem does this address? What motivated this approach?]

## Architecture sketch

### High-level design

```
[ASCII diagram or description of key components]
```

### Key components

| Component | Responsibility | Technology |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| [Component 1] | [What it does] | [Stack/tools] |
| [Component 2] | [What it does] | [Stack/tools] |
| [Component 3] | [What it does] | [Stack/tools] |

### Interfaces

[Key interfaces between components or with external systems]

### Data flow

1. [Data enters system via...]
2. [Processing step...]
3. [Output/storage...]

## Trade-offs

### Approach chosen vs alternatives

| Aspect | This approach | Alternative A | Alternative B |
|--------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| [Criterion 1] | [Assessment] | [Assessment] | [Assessment] |
| [Criterion 2] | [Assessment] | [Assessment] | [Assessment] |
| [Criterion 3] | [Assessment] | [Assessment] | [Assessment] |

### Accepted limitations

- [Limitation 1]: [Why acceptable]
- [Limitation 2]: [Why acceptable]

### Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [Approach] |
| [Risk 2] | [L] | [I] | [Approach] |

## Proof of concept

### Goals

What would a successful PoC demonstrate?

- [ ] [Validation goal 1]
- [ ] [Validation goal 2]
- [ ] [Validation goal 3]

### Scope

**Includes:**

- [PoC scope item 1]
- [PoC scope item 2]

**Excludes:**

- [Deferred for later]
- [Out of PoC scope]

### Success criteria

| Criterion | Target | Measurement |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| [Performance] | [Target] | [How measured] |
| [Correctness] | [Target] | [How verified] |
| [Feasibility] | [Target] | [How assessed] |

### Estimated effort

[Time/resource estimate for PoC]

## Questions to explore

- [ ] [Technical feasibility question]
- [ ] [Performance question]
- [ ] [Integration question]
- [ ] [Scalability question]

## Prior art

[What similar technical approaches exist? What can be learned from them?]

## Connections

[Related technical ideas, dependent systems, enabling technologies]

## Development notes

### {{ created }} - Initial capture

[Notes from the initial idea capture session]

## Open questions

[Unresolved technical questions]

## Next steps

- [ ] [Research or spike step]
- [ ] [PoC development step]
- [ ] [Validation step]
