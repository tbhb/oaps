# Python practices

This skill provides guidance for exploring, writing, reviewing, refactoring, testing, documenting, and maintaining Python code. It includes progressively-disclosed references on Python best practices, coding standards, testing frameworks, documentation tools, packaging and distribution methods, and common libraries.

## Steps

1. **Gather context** - Run `oaps skill orient python-practices` to see available references and workflows

1. **Identify relevant references** - Review the references table from step 1 and select those matching your task

1. **Load dynamic context and references** - Run `oaps skill context python-practices --references <names...>`

1. **Review loaded references and commands** - Read through the guidance. The **Allowed commands** table at the end of the output is authoritative for what commands can be run.

1. **Follow the workflow** - Adhere to the selected workflow's steps for structuring, writing, reviewing, or improving the specification.
