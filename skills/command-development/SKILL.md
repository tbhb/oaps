# Command development

This skill provides guidance for creating, reviewing, and testing Claude Code slash commands. It includes progressively-disclosed references on command structure, frontmatter fields, dynamic features, interactive patterns, and testing strategies.

## Steps

1. **Gather context** - Run `oaps skill orient command-development` to see available references and workflows

2. **Identify relevant references** - Review the references table from step 1 and select those matching your task

3. **Load dynamic context and references** - Run `oaps skill context command-development --references <names...>`

4. **Review loaded references and commands** - Read through the guidance. The **Allowed commands** table at the end of the output is authoritative for what commands can be run.

5. **Follow the workflow** - Adhere to the selected workflow's steps for creating, reviewing, or testing commands.
