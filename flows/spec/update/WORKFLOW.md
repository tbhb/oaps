description: Update an existing specification with changes
---

## Update specification

1. **Identify sections to update** - Determine scope of changes:

   - Locate affected sections, requirements, or test cases
   - Assess impact on dependent sections
   - Note related artifacts that may need updates

2. **Preserve existing requirement/test IDs** - Maintain traceability:

   - Never reassign or reuse IDs (permanent identifiers)
   - Mark deprecated items as DEPRECATED rather than removing
   - Assign new IDs for new requirements following identification scheme

3. **Apply changes incrementally** - Make controlled updates:

   - Update one section or requirement at a time
   - Maintain consistency with spec structure and style
   - Follow requirement-writing principles for new content
   - Use "shall" consistently for all requirements

4. **Update version and change history** - Document modifications:

   - Increment version number following project conventions
   - Add entry to change history with date and summary
   - Reference affected requirement/test IDs in change notes

5. **Verify consistency** - Check integration with unchanged sections:

   - Review cross-references and dependencies
   - Ensure terminology remains consistent
   - Validate that changes don't contradict existing requirements

6. **Run quick review** - Validate updated specification:

   - Apply review-checklist to modified sections
   - Check requirement quality for new/changed requirements
   - Verify test coverage for affected requirements
   - Ensure "shall" used consistently throughout
