description: Review an existing specification for completeness and quality
---

## Review specification

1. **Read the complete specification** - Understand full context:

   - Review all sections from overview to appendices
   - Note spec type, format, and intended audience
   - Identify stated scope and objectives

2. **Apply review-checklist systematically** - Check structural completeness:

   - Verify all required sections present
   - Check metadata completeness and accuracy
   - Validate cross-references and internal consistency

3. **Check requirement quality** - Assess individual requirements:

   - Apply requirement-writing principles to each requirement
   - Verify single responsibility per requirement
   - Check testability and measurability
   - Ensure "shall" used consistently for all requirements

4. **Verify test coverage** - Validate testing approach:

   - Apply test-design criteria to test cases
   - Check requirement-to-test traceability
   - Identify untested requirements
   - Assess test case clarity and completeness

5. **Document findings** - Record review results:

   - Use review-feedback template for consistency
   - Organize findings by section and category
   - Include specific examples and references

6. **Categorize issues by severity** - Prioritize remediation:

   - Critical: blocks implementation or creates ambiguity
   - Major: reduces clarity or testability
   - Minor: style or formatting improvements
