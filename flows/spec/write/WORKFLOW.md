description: Standard specification writing workflow

## Default specification workflow

1. **Gather context** - Understand what's being specified:

   - Identify stakeholders and audience
   - Clarify scope and boundaries
   - Review existing documentation and constraints

2. **Select spec format** - Choose structure based on context:

   - **Lightweight**: For iterative work, small features, internal tools
   - **Formal**: For APIs, contracts, compliance, external interfaces

3. **Draft specification sections** - Write incrementally:

   - Start with overview and scope
   - Define functional requirements
   - Document non-functional requirements and constraints
   - Include examples and edge cases

4. **Review for completeness and clarity** - Apply review checklist:

   - Verify all requirements are testable
   - Check for ambiguous language
   - Ensure consistency across sections
   - Validate against stakeholder expectations

5. **Define acceptance criteria and test cases** - Make verifiable:

   - Write acceptance criteria for each requirement
   - Identify test scenarios (happy path, edge cases, error conditions)
   - Document validation approach
