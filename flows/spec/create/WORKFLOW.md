description: Create a new specification from scratch
---

## Create specification

1. **Gather context** - Understand the specification requirements:

   - Identify stakeholders and target audience
   - Define scope and boundaries
   - Determine compliance or implementation needs

2. **Select format** - Choose appropriate specification structure:

   - Use spec-structure decision table to select lightweight vs formal
   - Consider audience technical level and governance requirements
   - Review template options in templates directory

3. **Generate unique spec ID** - Create permanent identifier:

   - Apply identification scheme based on spec type
   - Ensure ID follows project conventions
   - Document ID assignment for future reference

4. **Initialize spec directory structure** - Set up organization:

   - Create spec document with selected template
   - Establish supporting artifact directories if needed
   - Add to spec index or registry

5. **Draft overview, scope, definitions** - Establish foundation:

   - Write clear purpose and objectives
   - Define explicit scope boundaries (in-scope and out-of-scope)
   - Create definitions section for domain terminology

6. **Add initial requirements** - Document functional and non-functional requirements:

   - Assign proper requirement IDs using identification scheme
   - Follow requirement-writing principles for clarity
   - Use "shall" consistently for all requirement statements

7. **Define acceptance criteria** - Specify verification methods:

   - Add acceptance criteria for each requirement
   - Ensure criteria are testable and measurable
   - Reference test case templates if needed
