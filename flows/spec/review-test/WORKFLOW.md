## Reviewing test cases for coverage and correctness

1. **Verify requirement-to-test traceability** - Ensure all requirements are covered:

   - Check that each requirement has associated test cases
   - Verify test IDs reference correct requirement IDs

2. **Check test coverage** - Assess completeness of test scenarios:

   - Happy path scenarios are tested
   - Error conditions and edge cases are covered
   - Boundary values are tested

3. **Apply test-design checklist** - Use systematic review criteria:

   - Review against test-design reference guidelines
   - Ensure test methods are appropriate for requirements

4. **Verify test case structure is complete** - Check all fields are filled:

   - Test steps are clear and actionable
   - Expected results are specific and measurable
   - Prerequisites and test data are documented

5. **Check for missing edge cases** - Identify gaps in coverage:

   - Consider unusual inputs or states
   - Review error handling scenarios

6. **Validate test data is representative** - Ensure realistic test conditions:

   - Test data reflects actual usage patterns
   - Both valid and invalid data are tested

7. **Document coverage gaps** - Record findings and recommendations:

   - Identify requirements needing additional tests
   - Suggest new test cases to fill gaps
