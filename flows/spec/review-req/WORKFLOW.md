## Review requirements

1. **Check each requirement against requirement-writing checklist** - Verify quality criteria:

   - Requirement is atomic (single testable statement)
   - Language is clear and unambiguous
   - Statement is complete and self-contained
   - Uses "shall" consistently for all requirements
   - Reference review-checklist for complete criteria

2. **Ensure each requirement is atomic and testable** - Check testability:

   - Requirement can be verified through testing
   - Success criteria are measurable
   - No compound requirements (no "and" clauses)
   - Clear pass/fail conditions exist

3. **Check for ambiguous terms** - Identify problematic language:

   - Flag terms like "fast", "easy", "user-friendly"
   - Identify subjective or vague language
   - Ensure quantifiable terms have units
   - Reference review-checklist for ambiguous terms list

4. **Verify acceptance criteria are complete** - Validate test coverage:

   - All requirement aspects have acceptance criteria
   - Edge cases are covered
   - Error conditions are specified
   - Criteria are measurable and objective

5. **Check dependencies** - Validate requirement relationships:

   - Critical path requirements identified
   - Dependencies properly sequenced
   - No circular dependencies

6. **Document issues in review format** - Record findings:

   - Use review-feedback template
   - Categorize issues by severity
   - Provide specific, actionable feedback
   - Reference line numbers and requirement IDs
