## Updating existing test cases

1. **Identify test cases to update by ID** - Locate specific tests needing changes:

   - Use test IDs to find exact test cases
   - Review current test case content

2. **Preserve test ID** - Maintain permanent test identifier:

   - Never change the test ID
   - IDs remain stable across all updates

3. **Update test steps, expected results, or test data** - Modify test content as needed:

   - Revise steps to reflect requirement changes
   - Update expected results if behavior changed
   - Adjust test data for new scenarios

4. **Verify traceability to requirements still valid** - Ensure references are current:

   - Check that referenced requirement IDs still exist
   - Update requirement references if they changed

5. **Check if requirement changes require test updates** - Assess impact of changes:

   - Review related requirements for updates
   - Identify if new test cases are needed

6. **Update priority if risk level changed** - Adjust test importance:

   - Reassess priority based on current risk
   - Update severity or criticality ratings

7. **Document changes in spec history** - Maintain change record:

   - Note what changed and why
   - Include date and author of update
