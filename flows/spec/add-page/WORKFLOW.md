description: Add a new page to a multi-file specification
---

## Add new page to specification

1. **Determine purpose and scope** - Define what the new page will cover:

   - Identify the specific feature, component, or topic area
   - Determine if this represents a new section or subdivision of existing content
   - Ensure scope is distinct from existing pages

2. **Choose location in spec hierarchy** - Select appropriate placement:

   - Review existing spec structure and manifest
   - Determine if page is top-level or nested under a section
   - Follow naming conventions for the specification type

3. **Apply consistent formatting** - Use spec templates and standards:

   - Select appropriate template (feature, technical, lightweight, etc.)
   - Apply metadata section with author, dates, version
   - Initialize standard sections (Overview, Requirements, etc.)
   - Follow formatting rules from spec-writing references

4. **Add to spec manifest/index** - Update specification tracking:

   - Add entry to spec manifest or table of contents
   - Include page title, purpose, and location
   - Update any navigation or index structures

5. **Create cross-references from related pages** - Establish connections:

   - Link from parent or sibling pages
   - Add "See also" references where relevant
   - Update overview/index pages to reference new content

6. **Initialize requirements section with proper IDs** - Set up requirement tracking:

   - Use spec-appropriate ID prefix and numbering scheme
   - Start numbering at next available ID in sequence
   - Create initial requirement structure if content is known
