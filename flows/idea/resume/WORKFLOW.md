## Resume idea workflow

Use this workflow to continue development on an existing idea.

### Step 1: Read current state

Load and understand the idea's current position:

1. Open the idea document
2. Note the current status (seed, exploring, refining, crystallized, archived)
3. Read the core concept section
4. Review development notes chronologically
5. Check questions to explore and next steps sections

### Step 2: Summarize progress

Assess what's been accomplished:

1. List key findings from exploration
2. Note decisions already made
3. Identify questions that have been answered
4. Review any variations or scenarios developed
5. Check for unaddressed critique points

### Step 3: Identify next steps

Determine what to work on:

1. Review the open questions section
2. Check incomplete items in questions to explore
3. Identify the appropriate next workflow:
   - Still gathering information? Use `idea:explore`
   - Ready to challenge assumptions? Use `idea:refine`
   - Ready to finalize? Use `idea:crystallize`
   - Need to archive? Use `idea:archive`
   - Need to connect ideas? Use `idea:link`

### Step 4: Update and continue

Prepare for the next work session:

1. Add a dated note marking the resumption
2. Update any stale information
3. Adjust status if the idea has evolved
4. Load the appropriate next workflow
5. Proceed with the identified steps

### Step 5: Save progress

Preserve work at session end:

1. Update the `updated` date in frontmatter
2. Add session notes to development notes section
3. Update next steps with new actions
4. Commit changes with descriptive message
