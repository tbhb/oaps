description: Iterative refinement workflow for challenging and strengthening ideas

## Refine idea workflow

Use this workflow for ideas that have been explored and are ready for refinement.

### Step 1: Present current state

Summarize the idea's development:

1. Review the core concept statement
2. Summarize key exploration findings
3. List the main variations considered
4. Note primary constraints identified
5. Present to the user for context

### Step 2: Identify strengths

Acknowledge what's working:

1. What aspects of the idea are strongest?
2. What findings most support the concept?
3. Which variations show the most promise?
4. What feedback has been positive?
5. Document strengths explicitly

### Step 3: Surface weaknesses

Challenge the idea honestly:

1. Apply pre-mortem technique (assume failure, identify causes)
2. Categorize weaknesses:
   - Design flaws
   - Execution risks
   - Adoption barriers
   - Resource gaps
   - External factors
3. Rate each weakness by severity
4. Prioritize which to address

### Step 4: Generate counter-arguments

Argue against the idea:

1. Adopt devil's advocate position
2. Generate challenges for each strength
3. Consider perspectives:
   - Skeptic: Questions fundamentals
   - Competitor: Argues alternatives
   - User: Challenges usability
   - Finance: Questions ROI
4. Document counter-arguments and responses

### Step 5: Ask clarifying questions

Engage the user for input:

Present key decision points:

- "The idea could go in direction A or B. Which aligns better with your goals?"
- "This assumption is critical. Can you validate it?"
- "There's a trade-off between X and Y. What's your priority?"

Record responses in development notes.

### Step 6: Update the document

Incorporate refinement findings:

1. Update status to `refining` if not already
2. Revise core concept based on insights
3. Update assumptions section with findings
4. Add weakness documentation
5. Document counter-arguments and responses
6. Add risk assessment
7. Update next steps based on refinement
8. Commit with summary of refinement session

### Step 7: Assess readiness

Determine next steps:

- **More refinement needed**: Repeat this workflow
- **Ready to crystallize**: Proceed to `idea:crystallize` workflow
- **Needs more exploration**: Return to `idea:explore` workflow
- **Idea not viable**: Consider `idea:archive` workflow
