## Crystallize idea workflow

Use this workflow to finalize ideas that have been thoroughly explored and refined.

### Step 1: Review the journey

Gather all development materials:

1. Read the idea document from beginning to end
2. Review all dated development notes chronologically
3. List key findings from exploration
4. Summarize critique outcomes
5. Note all variations considered

### Step 2: Identify themes

Find patterns across development:

1. What concepts recur throughout exploration?
2. What questions kept coming back?
3. What constraints were most influential?
4. What connections proved most valuable?
5. Document 3-5 primary themes

### Step 3: Resolve tensions

Address remaining contradictions:

1. List any unresolved tensions
2. For each tension, choose a resolution strategy:
   - Prioritize: One concern dominates
   - Sequence: Both needed at different times
   - Segment: Different contexts, different solutions
   - Transcend: Find option satisfying both
   - Accept: Document as inherent trade-off
3. Document resolutions and rationale

### Step 4: Craft core insight

Distill to essential statement:

1. Draft a one-sentence summary
2. Use the template:
   > [Problem/opportunity] can be addressed by [approach/insight] because [key reasoning], enabling [value/outcome].
3. Test for clarity: Can someone unfamiliar understand it?
4. Refine until crisp and communicable

### Step 5: Write summaries

Create multiple summary levels:

1. **Headline** (1 sentence): Core insight
2. **Abstract** (1 paragraph):
   - Opening: Context/problem
   - Middle: Approach/insight
   - Closing: Implications/value
3. **Key points** (3-5 bullets): Main takeaways
4. **Implications**: What this enables
5. **Recommendations**: Suggested actions

### Step 6: Document open questions

Preserve deferred items:

1. List questions that remain unanswered
2. Note areas needing future exploration
3. Identify questions that may never be answered
4. Record questions for related ideas

### Step 7: Update status and finalize

Complete the crystallization:

1. Update status to `crystallized`
2. Update the `updated` date
3. Verify all sections have appropriate content
4. Check that related_ideas frontmatter is current
5. Ensure references are complete
6. Add final development note marking crystallization

### Step 8: Determine future role

Decide how the idea will be used:

- **Active application**: Idea moves to implementation
- **Reference value**: Preserved for future reference
- **Foundation**: Supports other active ideas
- **Historical**: Documents the learning journey

Document the intended role in a final note.

### Step 9: Commit and share

Preserve and communicate:

1. Commit with message: "Crystallize IDEA-NNN: [title]"
2. Consider sharing with relevant stakeholders
3. Update any indexes or registries
4. Link from related project documentation if applicable
