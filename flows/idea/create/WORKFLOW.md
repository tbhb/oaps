## Default idea workflow

This workflow guides new ideas from initial capture through full crystallization.

### Step 1: Capture the seed

Document the initial idea before it fades:

1. Create a new idea document using the appropriate template
2. Assign a unique ID (IDEA-NNN format)
3. Fill in required frontmatter fields
4. Write the core concept in 2-3 sentences
5. Record the context that sparked the idea
6. Set status to `seed`

### Step 2: Generate initial questions

Identify what needs exploration:

1. List 3-5 questions the idea raises
2. Note any obvious connections to existing ideas
3. Record immediate assumptions
4. Identify obvious constraints
5. Save and commit the seed document

### Step 3: Explore the idea

Transition to active investigation:

1. Update status to `exploring`
2. Apply exploration patterns (5 Whys, Socratic questioning)
3. Research prior art and document findings
4. Identify connections to other ideas
5. Document constraints and boundaries
6. Add dated exploration notes

### Step 4: Expand variations

Generate multiple expressions of the idea:

1. Define minimal and maximal versions
2. Generate at least 3 variations
3. Develop scenarios to test each variation
4. Add appropriate detail for the exploring stage
5. Update development notes with findings

### Step 5: Critique and refine

Challenge and strengthen the idea:

1. Update status to `refining`
2. Identify and document assumptions
3. Surface weaknesses honestly
4. Generate counter-arguments
5. Assess risks with severity and likelihood
6. Update idea based on critique insights

### Step 6: Synthesize and crystallize

Integrate learnings into final form:

1. Review all exploration and refinement notes
2. Identify recurring themes and patterns
3. Resolve tensions (or document as unresolved)
4. Craft core insight statement
5. Write summary at multiple levels (headline, abstract, executive)
6. Update status to `crystallized`

### Step 7: Finalize and link

Complete the idea document:

1. Verify all sections have appropriate content
2. Update related_ideas in frontmatter of connected ideas
3. Add final references and sources
4. Review for clarity and completeness
5. Commit the crystallized document
