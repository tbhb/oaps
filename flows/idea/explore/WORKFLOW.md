## Explore idea workflow

Use this workflow for deep exploration of ideas in seed or early exploring status.

### Step 1: Verify readiness

Confirm the idea is ready for exploration:

1. Core concept is documented
2. Initial context is captured
3. Status is `seed` or `exploring`
4. At least 2-3 initial questions exist

If not ready, complete seed capture first.

### Step 2: Apply question frameworks

Generate deeper questions:

1. Apply 5 Whys technique to core concept
2. Use Socratic questioning categories:
   - Clarification: "What exactly do we mean by...?"
   - Assumptions: "What are we assuming?"
   - Evidence: "What supports this?"
   - Perspectives: "How might others view this?"
   - Implications: "What follows if this is true?"
3. Document the question chains
4. Identify the most valuable questions

### Step 3: Research prior art

Investigate what already exists:

1. Define search terms from core concept
2. Check academic sources (if applicable)
3. Search industry resources and blogs
4. Explore open source implementations
5. Review standards and specifications
6. Document findings using the prior art template:

```markdown
### Prior art: [Name]
**Source**: [URL]
**Relevance**: High/Medium/Low
**Summary**: [Description]
**Gaps**: [What it lacks]
**Applicability**: [Relation to idea]
```

### Step 4: Discover connections

Link to related ideas:

1. Search idea collection for related terms
2. Review ideas with overlapping tags
3. Check ideas in the same problem domain
4. Identify connection types:
   - Supports / conflicts
   - Extends / depends
   - Combines / contrasts
5. Document connections in both ideas

### Step 5: Identify constraints

Define boundaries and limitations:

1. Technical constraints (platform, language, performance)
2. Resource constraints (time, budget, team)
3. Business constraints (strategy, policy, compliance)
4. User constraints (capabilities, preferences)
5. Categorize as must-have, should-have, nice-to-have

### Step 6: Document exploration

Record findings for future reference:

1. Update status to `exploring` if not already
2. Add dated exploration notes
3. Update prior art section
4. Update connections section
5. Add identified constraints
6. Mark answered questions as complete
7. Add new questions discovered during exploration
8. Commit with summary of exploration session
